## Add testers

* arrays (can reuse slice bits somehow)?
* structs
* channels?
* other things?

## Make exact equality check to deep data traversal

Right now it just uses reflect.DeepEqual but we should actually traverse the
data structure ourselves so we can record the path to an error if the two
structures don't match somewhere.

## Fix table layout with long strings

We need to check the term width and line wrap long strings. As it stands now
it's easily possible to end up with a table that is wider than the terminal.

## Passing test output should be better

Right now every call to something like `Idx` results in output like `Passed
test: foo` over and over. But it'd be nicer to do something like `Passed test:
foo - Idx(0)`.
