## What is this?

Detest is a test assertion library for Go that draws inspiration from the Perl
[Test2-Suite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Suite) library. The goal is to
provide a wide range of assertions that make it easy to work with complex data
structures, and to provide excellent output when an assertion fails.

It's still a work in progress, but it has enough assertions for many types of
tests.
